# UMKC_Hackathon_Fall_2018_IoT_Group_2

# Objectives:  
To create a smart home application which would use sensors such as temperature, air, pressure, fire and motion sensor and use all of them together to make a firefighting robot. The system will able to generate notification via Text message, email, Android or Web-application.  
## Goals:  
* Use the Sensor Tag (Humidity, Temperature etc) on Arduino or Raspberry platform.  
* Visualize all the sensor data via Node-red dashboard.
* Create an event based on the sensor data.
* Send notification via text message, email, Android or Web-application.  
* Integrate the above mentioned sensor to make an emergency firefighting robot.  

## Project Flow:  
* To extract the sensor data (Humadity, Pressure and Temperature) from the sensor.
* Use node red to upload the data to firebase.
* View those data remotely via a mobile app.  
* Control the AC, Fan and Light through the app remotely.  
* If any of the weather condition goes above safety limit, send a mobile notification and also send an email.  
* If there is a fire at home, the fire robot will sense the fire and put-out the fire.  
* A buzzer will make sound if there is any fire.  
* And a mobile notification and an email will be sent about the fire.
