# UMKC_Hackathon_Fall_2018_IoT_Group_2

# Objectives:  
To create a smart home application which would use sensors such as temperature, air, pressure, fire and motion sensor and use all of them together to make a firefighting robot. The system will able to generate notification via Text message, email, Android or Web-application.  
## Goals:  
* Use the Sensor Tag (Humidity, Temperature etc) on Arduino or Raspberry platform.  
* Visualize all the sensor data via Node-red dashboard.
* Create an event based on the sensor data.
* Send notification via text message, email, Android or Web-application.  
* Integrate the above mentioned sensor to make an emergency firefighting robot.
